The scuba diver is in the bathtub. When the player presses the scuba diver with the mouse, the diver goes into the bathtub.
The diver would hold their breath until the maximum but as soon as the player does not let the diver out until they 
exceed the maximum point, the player loses the game. The player gets point every second the diver is in the water yet they
must let the scuba diver out before it exceeds the maximum point.
