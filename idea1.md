There are two rubber ducks in the bathtub. One rubber duck is a mother duck chasing around her baby rubber duck. 
The player could control the baby duck by moving their mouse points while the mother duck would move around through 
the coding to catch the baby rubber duck. If the player does not get caught by the mother duck for a minute
( there is going to be a counting clock on the top of the game screen ), then the player wins.
However, if the baby duck gets caught by the mother duck, the player loses.
